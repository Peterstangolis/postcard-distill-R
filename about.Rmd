Originally educated in Kinesiology and Health Sciences from York University 
working in the rehabilitation field for 15 years. Then discovered the wonderful
world of online courses. I completed numerous online courses in data analytics
and data science through Coursera, EDx, LinkedIn Learn and finally decided to 
complete the Data Science Certificate program at Sheridan College completely online,
while also working full time. 

This page is a place to mark my progress with online courses, employment and other
fun facts I care to share about me...
